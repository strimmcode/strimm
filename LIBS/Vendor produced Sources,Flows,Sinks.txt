VENDOR PRODUCED SOURCES,FLOWS,SINKS
***********************************
In the folder LIBSs is a library test_vendor.jar.  It contains DLLSink, DLLFlow, DLLSource.
These were made in FullGraph19_Vendor project.

In order to use a jar in Intellij, file/project structure/settings and then attach the jar file as a
Java library - and will sort out the class path and the IDE will run the app.

In the case of the package it is simpler, just drop the jar file into the jars folder
and the Source, Flow and Sink can be referenced in the JSON.
