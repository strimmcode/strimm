The main source of bugs with Arduinos is using the wrong COM and baudRate, also the Arduinos have very small RAM
and can only store 10 samples.s

ArduinoSink receives a STRIMMArduinoControlBuffer which indicates whether the Sink is to be in continuous or episodic
mode. This is determined by the first field ArduinoMode.  Whether the DO is to be obtained from data or file is
determined by the field bFromFile. The remainder contains the location of the DO data or the actual DO data in the form
of arrays.

It is the previous flows or sources which construct the STRIMMArduinoControlBuffer which make the decision as to
how the data will be emitted by the Arduino.

To demonstrate this ArduinoSourceFileTest can be configured to emit a buffer with intervalMS (alternatively change the
JSON entry).

BUG some sort of shutdown error going from arduinoSource to arduinoSink files

ArduinoSource creates a STRIMMSignalBuffer1 and then sends the data through the akka-graph.
The data is packed into heterogeneous rows in the following order:
digitialTime (arduino does not measure this however it can be calculated to 1us)
