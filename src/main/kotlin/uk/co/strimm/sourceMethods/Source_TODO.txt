SOURCE TODO
***********

1) Arduino and NIDAQ unification of the code, as far as is possible use the same kind of subclass of STRIMMBuffer
2) RESTSource, RESTSourceRaw with a website demo. The RESTSource polls the website, and the website will
create the STRIMMBuffer and marshall it back to the RESTSource. Other users can then alter the parameters behind how the
website will return data. So the website could have databases, cloud services, etc
3) TCPSoure,UDPSource, TCPSourceRaw, UDPSourceRaw: as an extension and fleshed out version of TCPMethod
4) PythonSource runs a script.py which is specified in the cfg, need to decide how the data comes out of the
script and is turned into a STRIMMBuffer.
5) MouseSource, KeyboardSource cfg defines the rate at which the mouse and the keyboard are polled and turn the
data into a STRIMMBuffer and is sent through the akka-graph.
6) InputStringSource derived from ModalDlgSourceBaseMethod where you enter a string - which is then packaged
and passed through the akka-graph along with its timestamp in a STRIMMBuffer.
7) HF5SourceMethod - creates STRIMMBuffer from an h5 file.
8) (IMPORTANT) DLLSource - cfg defines a dll file which is loaded into address space and then the source class within it
is runaccording to interface ISource c++ interface via JNI.
9) ActorSourceTest - clean this up - so that gets samples from an external actor
10) (IMPORTANT) Develop a single CMMCore sources - where a core a selected in cfg and has a global presence which could be
used by other components - rather than everything having the same core.
11) MatlabSource - runs a Matlab script to generate a STRIMMBuffer - could be a Matlab class
12) (IMPORTANT) ModalDlgSourceBaseMethod - a base method to be subclassed, which will launch a modal dlg box as it is init, which
will then allow the Source to be configured at runtime.
13) More consistent naming of the classes (remove Method name)
14) (IMPORTANT) Load and run jars with classes derived from interface SourceMethod so vendors can quickly develop sources  DONE 240223
15) (NICE to do) ComponentObjectModelSource - runs a ISource c++ interface from COM once component registered to the OS
