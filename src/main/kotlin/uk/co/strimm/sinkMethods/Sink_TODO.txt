SINK TODO
*********
1)(IMPORTANT) DLLSink, so that a vendor can just drop in a DLL into a folder, the cfg
would name the dll, and it would be called via an ISink C++ interface through JNI.
2)(NICE to do) ComponentObjectModelSink, registered component via COM so that it can
be called generically across the OS (say registered by regsrv32 etc)
3) RESTSink, uses a REST interface to send the results to an external website
4) TCPMethod - port this to TCPSink
5) TCPSink - act as a client and sends string and data to a TCP server (which could
be localmachine)
6) UDPSink - act as client and sends string and data as UDP packets to a UDP server
7) (IMPORTANT) decide on the format for marshalling the STRIMMBuffer received by the
sink onto a USP or TCP server.
8) SERIALSinkMethod, send string and data taken from a STRIMMBuffer to device on Serial COM port.
9) (IMPORTANT) PythonSink runs a Python function or class which takes the STRIMMBuffer
converts it into Python types and executes a Python script.
10) MatlabSink, runs a Matlab class or function which takes a marshalled version of the
STRIMMBuffer.
11) ModalDlgSinkBaseMethod, launches a Modal dialog so that the Sink can be parameterised
at run-time.  Other classes will inherit from this class.
12) SinkImageJPixelTest, probably not longer needed so can remove.
13) (IMPORTANT) SinkHistogramMethod, SinkTraceMethod need to be redone with better
graphics, could go to windows and do through QT.
14) (NICE to do) a real-time TensorFlow link to do deep-learning on the fly
15) (IMPORTANT) load from JARs which conform to SinkMethod interface.  DONE 240223
